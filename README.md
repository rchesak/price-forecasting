# price-forecasting
Price forecasting data science challenge, which I hacked together in a strict 3.5 day time limit.

### Quick Results Summary
The linear regression model explains 84% of the variance in regional average avocado prices across the USA (R-squared = 0.8372). 

On average, the selected model predicts avocado prices within 11 cents of the true value (mean absolute error = 0.113, unit = USD).

## Presentation
See the presentation [powerpoint](https://github.com/rchesak/price-forecasting/blob/master/chesak_avocado_case_study.pptx) or [pdf](https://github.com/rchesak/price-forecasting/blob/master/chesak_avocado_case_study.pdf) for an executive overview, followed by a technical overview.

## Code
See the [exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/rchesak/price-forecasting/blob/master/exploratory-analysis.ipynb) and [modelling](https://github.com/rchesak/price-forecasting/blob/master/modelling_averageprice.ipynb) Jupyter Notebooks for hacked code. Please forgive some of the code neatness, as this was a hackathon-style project done in 3.5 days.
